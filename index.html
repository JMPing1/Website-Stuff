<h1>How to make the Lewis Dot Structure</h1>

<p>To find the Lewis Dot Structure for you compound you first need to know the number of electrons in your compound. On the periodic table there are 18 numbers on the top of each column, but only 1 and 13-18 are used. To find the number of electrons for 13-18 you subtract 10. For example Carbon (C) is in column number 14 so Carbon has 4 electrons because 14 minus 10 is 4.</p>
