<h1>How to make the Lewis Dot Structure</h1>

<p>To find the Lewis Dot Structure for your compound you first need to know the number of electrons in your compound. On the periodic table there are 18 numbers on the top of each column, but only 13-18 are used, except there is an exception which is for Hydrogen which is in column one and only has 1 electron. To find the number of electrons for 13-18 you subtract 10. For example Carbon (C) is in column number 14 so Carbon has 4 electrons because 14 minus 10 is 4.</p>

  <p> So for instance your compound is NHâ‚ƒ.Nitrogen (N) is in column 15 so Nitrogen has 5 electrons and Hydrogen (H) has 1.
